# botchallenge-epam-2020

Here is my bot generation 4.

What he can:
- harvest walls
- harvest perks
- harvest other bombermans %) (not 100% but has guite good melee skills)
- knows how run away dead meat chopper
- decision - whom to attack - is based on possibility quite safe reach them. Now priorities are: away from dead chopper, harvest perks, attack choppers, attack palyers, harvest walls

That he can't (and wasn't implemented):
- global goal was just harvest and run away i.e. no global optimmizations (like harvest more at short time) or find optimal way (actually not true due to used BFS/greedy algorithms to find best paths)
- has some "childhood diseases" like going into the dead end and blocking himself with timer bomb.... yep 
- here used some kind of potential fields but they are tooo granular (actually based on Elements.py).

Was funny and cool %)
